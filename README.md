# Restock-Sniper
This program was created with the intention to providing a solution to anyone seeking to snipe the restocking of an item which is sold out.\
**definitions.txt** and **supportedsites.txt** will be updated as I discover more websites to support.\
Any questions, or if there are websites you want added, feel free to email me at *johnthiell@gmail.com*.

# Usage
First, create a file known as **websites.txt**, this will serve as the list of links you want sniped.\
Insert the **direct link** to the item being sold.\

# Creating Your Own Definitions
To create your own definition, you first need to examine the 'sold out' element on the webpage of the item you are trying to snipe.\
This program works by **class names**, and these belong inside the **definitions.txt** file.\
Additionally, add the website to the **supportedsites.txt** file in the format of **"website.com"**.
